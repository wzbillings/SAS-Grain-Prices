* Color the points of the time series by the President's political party. The
	default colors are already red and blue so we don't need to change them!
	Also plots a gray line underneath the points, since the JOIN option for
	the SCATTER statement will not connect the points in order.;

* Make a scatterplot of the log price vs each covariate, ignoring the time
	series component of the data. There is not an easy way to connect the points
	like a phase portrait using PROC SGPLOT.;
* I divided this into two plots so they would fit on one page nicer. In the final
	manuscript they could be put side by side.;

TITLE2 "SUMMARY STATISTICS BY PRESIDENTIAL PARTY AND GRAIN";

* Simple forecasting;
*******************************************************************************;

* Now instead of just using regression models, we can try to fit a more
	flexible forecasting model using PROC ARIMA.
	First, we need a time variable that is actually a SAS date, so we create 
	that first.;
DATA TS_DAT;
	SET HOME.GRAINS;
	T = MDY(1, 1, YEAR);
RUN;

* Next we use the IDENTIFY modeling stage. We check up to 30 lags in the
	first ARIMA modeling stage, and also explicitly test for stationarity at
	the first 10 differences using the random walk with drift test. We
	also use the SCAN method, which is a heuristic for identifying
	candidate ARIMA models.;

* Next we use the ESTIMATE modeling stage. We fit several different ARIMA
	models to the data in order to see which fits our time series the best,
	and if any have white noise as the error term.;
* One PROC ARIMA can contain multiple ESTIMATE statements, but I split these
	into multiple PROC steps to make the output easier to read.;
* We are basically fitting all of these models to get the AIC and see which is
	the best fit.;
